* **[Crop Recommendation]():**

This recommendation system will focus on giving viable options to the farmer taking into account their location and weather condition.

This System builds on top of past weather data of more than 50 years to make a weather model which can predict upto 80% accurate weather. 

* **[Crop Information]():**

New and better practices of growing crops and crop protection are displayed to the farmer in a interactive and easy to understand UI
The crop information data is researched and collected.

* **[Pest Analysis]():** 

Deep Learning Models have been trained for various crops with 3-4 pests and diseases for detecting pests and diseases using image recognition.
Some models perform upwards of 80%

* **[Pest Model API]()**
This API is created to try and test the pest models. The instructions to run the API are given [here](https://www.google.com)

* **Weather Models:** 

They are in 2 types.
- [State Wise]()
- [Cluster Wise]()

*State Wise*
Each state weather has been taken for more than 50 years and a time series model has been used to make a weather prediction model.

*Cluster Wise*
India is divided into 15 agroclimatic zones. These zones are taken into account and models for these clusters has been made.
They are beneficial over state models as clusters have similar weather conditions hence low computation power will be needed.
